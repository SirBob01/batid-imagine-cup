THINGS TO DO

// General UX/UI
- Marker definitions
- User tutorial (can also be optimized for demo)
- More variance in sample markers

// Account system
- Simple account system, social media authentication

// Feed/map

- Radius filtering (feed and hide markers) --> use Haversine formula
- If possible, vote without refreshing
- Social media sharing (fix image embed)
- PERMALINKS ON POSTS (anchor tag?)


// Add report
- Image preview
- Map marker and radius preview (when writing a report, preview the pin on the map and show the radius adjusting as well upon slide--can be done with pure js I think)


// Administrative panel?
- Showcase report verification
